- create requester
    - look for available workers
    - submit code to chain


larger refactor:

    - use smalldot with worker 
    - figure out how to use substrate wasm builder for ink contract to not need to use cargo contract cli
        to build wasm binary

    - make contract e2e test run against runtime only if possible similar to ink_e2e sandbox feature .
