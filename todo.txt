- figure out integration test that uses or does not use docker compose
- use logging crate. Trac/subscbribe

- requester
    - submit code with params
    - payment
        - look into module.resources_required()
    - look for available workers, and send preferred worker in submit job request

- worker
    - figure out wasmtime 

- catalog
    - make contract upgradeable 

- runtime
    - governance pallet so you can kill process 

larger refactor:
    - use p2p to send workload to worker 
        - requester submits job
            - minimal metadata
        - worker listens for jobs
        - when job is found and selected,
        - p2p communications are sent throughout network
        - requester gets job acceptance
        - requester sends payload to worker

    - peer to peer to return response from worker. Still have to figure out payment 
    - use zk snark as proof that worker completed work
    - use smalldot with worker 
    - figure out how to use substrate wasm builder for ink contract to not need to use cargo contract cli
        to build wasm binary
    - make contract e2e test run against runtime only if possible similar to ink_e2e sandbox feature .
