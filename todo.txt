create script to run requester-worker tests so they can be run in a pipeline
    - create users part of test
    - have //alice fund users as part of test setup

- requester
    - payment
        - look into module.resources_required()
    - look for available workers, and send preferred worker in submit job request

- worker
    - refactor error handling and logging 
    - figure out wasmtime 

- catalog
    - make contract upgradeable 

- runtime
    - governance pallet so you can kill process 

larger refactor:
    - figure out drink so you can have a lighter runtime process and not need one chain
        - also means you wouldnt need to specify dev accounts per test
    - use zk snark as proof that worker completed work
    - use smalldot with worker 
    - figure out how to use substrate wasm builder for ink contract to not need to use cargo contract cli
        to build wasm binary
