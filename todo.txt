refactor job runner to create task that has builder pattern to build up job and execute
    so it can be in its own task::spawn()

refactor contract client so that it calls subxt client

create derive macro for mock stuff

- requester
    - payment
        - look into module.resources_required()
    - look for available workers, and send preferred worker in submit job request

- catalog
    - make contract upgradeable 

- runtime
    - governance pallet so you can kill process 

larger refactor:
    - figure out drink so you can have a lighter runtime process and not need one chain
        - also means you wouldnt need to specify dev accounts per test
    - use zk snark as proof that worker completed work
    - use smalldot with worker 
    - figure out how to use substrate wasm builder for ink contract to not need to use cargo contract cli
        to build wasm binary
