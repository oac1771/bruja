- create requester
    - look for available workers
        - see if there is a way to read storage without calling the contract itself
- worker:
    - listen for submitted job events

- make contract upgradeable
    - wrap state in lazy 

larger refactor:
    - use smalldot with worker 
    - figure out how to use substrate wasm builder for ink contract to not need to use cargo contract cli
        to build wasm binary
    - make contract e2e test run against runtime only if possible similar to ink_e2e sandbox feature .
