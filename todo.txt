larger refactor:
    - create docker container to build artifacts
        - see if this will let you run colima with aarch64 and 
            use docker build --platform to build x86 for builder
            and node/worker/requester containers

    - figure out how to use substrate wasm builder for ink contract to not need to use cargo contract cli
        to build wasm binary
